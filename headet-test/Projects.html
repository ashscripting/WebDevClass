            <br>during summer vacations I worked on several c++ projects to help me learn the
            language and gain some experience with making programs using the c++ language.
            learning this language helped me improve my problem solving skills and also sharpened
            my skills on  a new programming language which can help me with my career in future.
            c++ is also one of the most used programing languages to this date with tons of popular
            game and app being written in this language. another reason for popularity of c++ is it"s
            memory management tools that helps software developers make more efficient and secure apps.
