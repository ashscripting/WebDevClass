            <br>during summer vacations I worked on several c++ projects to help me learn the
            language and gain some experience with making programs using the c++ language.<br>
            learning this language helped me improve my problem-solving skills and also sharpened
            my skills on  a new programming language which can help me with my career in the future.<br>
            c++ is also one of the most used programing languages to this date with tons of popular
            game and app being written in this <br> another reason for popularity of c++ is it"s
            memory management tools that helps software developers make more efficient and secure apps.

            <br>last year as first-year networking and security students we had tons of practice
            with Python and developed numerous mini-programs and projects throughout the year.<br> one of the labs we did
            is the program in the picture which describes houses and which is an object in the class and the point of
            the lab was for us to learn how objects work and use the concept to give a user output that consist of objects
            going between class and being processed.
